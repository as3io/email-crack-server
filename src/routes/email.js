 * This will load a dasherize file from the `emails` directory, based on
 * the `:name` request parameter.
 *
 * For example, accessing `/email/current-time` in the browser will
 * load the `current-time.hbs` file from the `emails` folder.
 *
 * Currently, the Express `req` object is passed as the template context,
 * meaning you can display any property found on the request within the template.
 * As an example, try loading `/email/request-context` in your browser.
